2. **Bug Bounty** - Community testing incentives
3. **Gradual Rollout** - Limited initial deployment

## Resource Allocation

### Team Roles
- **Smart Contract Developer** - Ethereum/Aptos contracts
- **Frontend Developer** - React/1inch SDK integration
- **Backend Developer** - Cross-chain coordination
- **DevOps Engineer** - Infrastructure and deployment

### Technology Budget
- **Development Tools** - Hardhat, testing frameworks
- **Infrastructure** - RPC nodes, monitoring services
- **Security** - Audit services, bug bounty program
- **Hosting** - Frontend deployment, backend services

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
